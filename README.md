# README for Customer Churn Analyzer (Python Project)

---

## 📝 Project Overview

**Customer Churn Analyzer** is an interactive Python-based tool that allows Business Analysts and Data Scientists to:

- Upload customer data.
- Build a churn prediction model using logistic regression.
- Simulate retention campaign effects.
- Estimate financial impact of churn reduction.
- Export simulation results.

---

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit (interactive web interface)
- scikit-learn (machine learning)
- pandas, numpy (data processing)
- matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)

---

## 📂 Project Structure

```
ChurnAnalyzer.py              # Main Python app
sample_customer_data.csv       # Sample dataset for testing
```

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Install Python 3.7 or higher.
- Verify installation:

```bash
python --version
```

- Install required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn streamlit
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Extract the ZIP

Unzip `ChurnAnalyzer_WithData.zip` and navigate into the folder.

### 2️⃣ Run the analyzer:

```bash
streamlit run ChurnAnalyzer.py
```

✅ Streamlit will launch the app in your default web browser.

## 📄 Sample Dataset

A file `sample_customer_data.csv` is provided for testing.

| CustomerID | Tenure | Purchases | Engagement | Churn |
|------------|--------|-----------|------------|-------|
| 1001 | 24 | 10 | 85 | 0 |
| 1002 | 36 | 15 | 90 | 0 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

- **Churn column is mandatory (1 = churned, 0 = retained).**
- You can replace with your own customer dataset following this format.

## 🔬 Analyzer Features

- Upload your dataset.
- Automatic feature selection for numeric columns.
- Logistic regression model for churn prediction.
- Simulate retention campaigns using a slider.
- Calculate projected churn rate after retention actions.
- Estimate revenue loss reduction.
- Export adjusted predictions as CSV.

## ⚠ Challenges and Limitations

### 1️⃣ Simple Model
- Uses only logistic regression for churn prediction.
- Does not support advanced ML models like random forests, XGBoost, or deep learning.

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- No automatic feature engineering or categorical encoding.
- Requires numeric features to work best.

### 3️⃣ Limited Input Validation
- Minimal input checking — assumes good quality data.
- Needs better error handling for messy datasets.

### 4️⃣ No Real-Time Prediction
- Designed for batch analysis, not real-time scoring.

### 5️⃣ No Segmentation Analysis
- No built-in analysis by customer segments (e.g., high-value vs low-value customers).
- Adding segmentation could improve business insights.

### 6️⃣ Limited Visualization
- Only basic confusion matrix provided.
- Could add more visualizations: churn by tenure, churn probability distributions, segment breakdowns, etc.

### 7️⃣ Local Only
- Currently runs locally; no web deployment or multi-user collaboration.

## 🔮 Possible Extensions

- Support advanced ML models (random forest, gradient boosting, neural networks).
- Allow segmentation-based analysis.
- Add richer interactive visualizations (histograms, trendlines, waterfall charts).
- Support time-series customer lifetime value (CLV) projections.
- Allow deployment to cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Build full enterprise-level churn analytics dashboard.
